# ‚ùî About me

Hello, my name is Kacper!

I'm a C++ software enginner, with a Master's degree in Computer Science, graduated from the [University of Zielona G√≥ra](https://uz.zgora.pl/), Poland, at the [Faculty of Computer, Electrical and Control Engineering](https://wiea.uz.zgora.pl/).

My main interrests include programming both in high and low abstraction levels, IoT, general STEM (such as physics, maths, astronomy and so on) and video games. I spend my free time playing and coding private projects from time to time.

For a couple of years I was an active member of [Space Engineering Science Club](https://knik.spaceregion.eu/) at my university, where I was the team leader of the software and electronics teams. The primary project I took part in and overseen the progress of was a marsian rover prototype, based on STM microcontrollers. I was responsible for the software architecture, communication design between components, and electrical design of the rover.
My additional activities within the science club included training new members and organizing programming and electronics workshops for middle school students during classes in colaboration with [The Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences](https://cbkpan.pl/) (CBK PAN).

# üíª Projects

My main projects include:

- [ ] [Road To The Centre](https://github.com/KacperWojciechowski/RoadToTheCentre): (v.1.0)
  - `C++20, CMake, GTest`
  - Made as a part of an amateur game jam between friends
  - A text-based economic game where the goal is to travel to the center of the galaxy
  - Made in a scallable way, allowing for implementing new features and mechanics
  - Basic idea inspired by the Spore game

> NOTE: Graph library currently under major refactor from v0.1 revert 
- [ ] [Graph library](https://github.com/KacperWojciechowski/Graphs): (v.0.5)
  - `C++20, CMake, GTest` 
  - Got inspiration from a university project
  - Library offering different graph representations with basic interface
  - Basic graph algorithms class
  - To be introduced:
    - Benchmark class for efficiency tests of various algorithms, with algorithm execution logging option
   
- [ ] [DungeonCrawler](https://github.com/KacperWojciechowski/DungeonCrawler): (v.1.0 - final)
  - `Java, Maven`
  - Network dungeon crawler game based on client-server model
  - The game state is controled and validated via server
  - Each player action sends a request which is then validated on the server side
  - Custom graph-based map generation and representation
  - Message-based communication between client and server using JSON

# üßë‚Äçüî¨ Research

- [ ] [Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Libraries in C++ for Applications in Biostatistics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382162127_Comparative_Analysis_of_Machine_Learning_Libraries_in_C_for_Applications_in_Biostatistics)

# Personal backlog
- [x] Complete the translation of my master's thesis;
- [x] Make a personal website;
- [ ] `(ongoing)` Drop current Graphs partial implementation, ship the initial basic implementation and refactor it;
- [ ] Move CPM initial implementation to the Graph project and refactor it accordingly;
- [ ] Make VTT (Virtual Table Top) engine for TT RPGs in Rust;
