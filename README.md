### ❔ About me

- 👋 Hi, I’m Kacper Wojciechowski

I'm a C++ Developer, currently at the last stretch of my Master's Degree studies in Computer Science at the [University of Zielona Góra](https://wiea.uz.zgora.pl/), Poland 🎓. I'm interrested in programming, IoT, general STEM (such as astrophysics, math, etc.), japanese and video games. In my free time I play video games and code some stuff from time to time. I used to work with embedded platforms such as STM32, Arduino and ESP8266 in both work and a [Space Engineering Science Club](https://www.facebook.com/KNIKUZ) (feel free to check them out 😉). Recently I shifted into more high-level programming, using OOP paradigm, and started learning TDD as a way for creating more flexible and reliable software.  

### 👨‍💼 Career overview

- Intern / Junior C++ Embedded Developer at Heavy Kinematic Machines, Zielona Góra, Poland;
- Science assistant, Leibnitz Institute for High Performance Microelectronics, Frankfurt at Oder;
- Sooftware Engineer, Nokia Solutions and Networks, Wrocław, Poland.

### 💻 Projects

My main projects include:

- [ ] Graph library: 
  - Got inspiration from a university project
  - Library offering adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations with basic interface (currently during a major refactor)
  - Class offering a handful of basic graph algorithms (work in progress)
  - Benchmark class for efficiency tests of various algorithms, with algorithm execution logging option
  - Refactored and developed using TDD

- [ ] CPM Solver:
  - Simple Critical Path Method for job sequence optimization
  - Can be used to plan concurrent job execution in a company / industrial environment
  - Planned to be extended with CPM-Cost method
  - Possibly gonna change into a simple optimization library when Simplex and Brown algorithm will be included
