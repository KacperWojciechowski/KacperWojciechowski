# ❔ About me

- 👋 Hi, I’m Kacper Wojciechowski

I'm a C++ Developer, and an M.CS, graduated from the [University of Zielona Góra](https://wiea.uz.zgora.pl/), Poland. I'm interrested in programming, IoT, general STEM (such as astrophysics, math, etc.), japanese and video games. In my free time I play video games, code private projects from time to time, and take part in [Space Engineering Science Club](https://www.facebook.com/KNIKUZ) (feel free to check them out 😉). I used to work with embedded platforms such as STM32, Arduino and ESP8266 at the start of my career. In December 2022 I shifted to more high-level programming, using OOP paradigm, and started learning TDD as a way for creating more flexible and reliable software, making embedded programming more of a hobby.

# 💻 Projects

My main projects include:

> NOTE: Graph library currently on hold 
- [ ] Graph library: 
  - Got inspiration from a university project
  - Library offering adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations with basic interface (currently during a major refactor)
  - Class offering a handful of basic graph algorithms (work in progress)
  - ***Currently under a refactor***
  - To be introduced:
    - Benchmark class for efficiency tests of various algorithms, with algorithm execution logging option

- [ ] CPM Solver:
  - Simple Critical Path Method for job sequence optimization
  - Can be used to plan concurrent job execution in a company / industrial environment
  - Planned to be extended with CPM-Cost method
  - Possibly gonna change into a simple optimization library when Simplex and Brown algorithm will be included
